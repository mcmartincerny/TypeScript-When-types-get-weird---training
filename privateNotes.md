# notes:

- do not use "any" if possible should be the first lecture
- try to avoid using "as" if possible should also be in the first lecture
- show "Paste JSON as Code" library to type fetch result
- show superstruct that will check the data in runtime and infer the type
- Matt Pocock on YT

export type OutputKey = `opt-${number}`;

choices: { [key: OutputKey]: string };
